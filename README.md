## Hello, names Tyler.
### Your time is precious, I understand that. So I'll treat this introduction like a speed date.

 - I am an undergrad bachelors student at Griffith majoring in software development.
 - I am currently working for Claim in here in Brisbane as a full-stack front end developer.
 - This career path is everything I've ever wanted, I love my job.
 - I want to diversify, I refuse to stick to one path for the rest of my career.
 - I have a strong focus on web development.

### Some statistics about my development
